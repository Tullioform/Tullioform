## Hello! Thank you for visiting my page! 

Currently (as of 2025) I am an MSc student in Condensed Matter Physics. 
I have attended the University of Naples Federico II and Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.
I'm interested in quantum technologies, simulation of physical systems, statistical mechanics and data analysis.
I am planning to take a master in Quantum Science and Technologies after my degree.

### Here I will post my works, which could be actual university projects or projects I did for leisure, feel free to take a look!
